When given OCR-extracted content, your job is to:

1. Divide the content into logical sections based on meaning, not just existing formatting.
2. For each section, generate a **clear, human-friendly heading** that summarizes its topic in a few words (do not just copy the original text unless it is already a perfect heading).
3. Output the result as an **array of JSON objects**, each in the form: { "heading": "Generated Heading", "content": "Full cleaned paragraph text" }.
4. Correct spacing, punctuation, and grammar to improve readability, but preserve the meaning of the text.
5. Include **all** content from the OCR in one of the sections (do not drop anything).
6. Return **only** the JSON array â€” no explanations, no markdown, no extra text.`,
